# Deep Learning Lab

This repository is for the experiments conducted as part of my Deep Learning Lab, containing implementations, analyses, and experiments performed during the course for my 6th Semester (2025).

## Student Details

- **Name**: Lalrinfeli Hnamte
- **Roll No**: 2K22/CO/265
- **Group**: E5, G2
  


## List of Experiments

1. **Experiment 1**: Create a Classification Model for MNIST Dataset using only Python and Numpy without the help of any pre-built Libraries.
2. **Experiment 2**: Using Numpy, train a Neural Network to classify linearly separable dataset (without any hidden layer).
3. **Experiment 3**: Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images in the Cats vs. Dogs dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── Experiment 1/       
│   ├── Documentation.md  
│   ├── experiment1.ipynb 
├── Experiment 2/       
│   ├── Documentation.md  
│   ├── experiment2.ipynb 
├── Experiment 3/      
│   ├── Documentation.md  
│   ├── experiment3.ipynb
├── README.md           
```

Each experiment folder contains:
- **Documentation.md**: Notes or descriptions explaining the experiments.
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: Code and results for the experiment.
